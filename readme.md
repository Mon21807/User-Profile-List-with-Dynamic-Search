# React User Profiles Search

This project implements a dynamic list of user profiles with a search functionality using React. Users can search for profiles by name, and the list updates in real-time to display matching profiles.

## Features

- **Dynamic Rendering**: Renders a list of user profiles dynamically using React.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for profiles by name.
- **Real-time Updates**: Updates the list of displayed profiles in real-time as the user types in the search field.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## File Structure

- **index.html**: HTML file serving as the entry point for the application.
- **styles.css**: CSS file containing styles for the application.
- **README.md**: This file providing information about the project.

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- HTML: Markup language for creating the structure of the web page.
- CSS: Styling language for enhancing the visual appeal of the application.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single HTML file (`index.html`) that includes React and Babel scripts for rendering the React components. Additionally, there is a CSS file (`styles.css`) for styling the application.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. View the list of user profiles.
3. Use the search input field to search for specific profiles by name.

## Notes

- The user profiles data can be fetched from an API or stored locally within the application.
- React allows for efficient rendering of dynamic data, making it ideal for implementing real-time search functionality.
